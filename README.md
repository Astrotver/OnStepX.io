OnStepX Telescope Controller
===========================

# This fork
In this fork i migrated the project to platform.io. I use it on BTT SKR, so only this env is currently available. I have no plans for LTS, but i will add features that i need. Please don't expect me to maintain this fork forever.

**P.io makes flashing more easy reproducible for tech-savvy person familiar with IDEs, build environments, dependency management etc.
If you are not, you better use original Howard's version and follow instructions in official wiki.**

## Current features
* Config files can be under .gitignore
* You can set focuser home positions to min or max, not only middle.

## Planned features
* Fix flashing of ESP8266 over SKR
* Implement controlling focuser (and maybe other axis) via encoder wheel

# Configuration
This version expects you to create Extended.userconfig.h and Userconfig.h instead of editing VCS-tracked files. Some defines are in pio ini file.

# Flashing
Use any IDE (VScode, CLion) with platform.io plugin, or raw platform.io cli to flash your device. Choose the corresponding build env from pio ini, or create your own.

# What is OnStepX?
OnStepX is the advanced version of the OnStep computerized telescope controller with support for interfacing with/controlling a variety of motor drivers (and so motors) including Step/Dir, ODrive, and Servo (a combination of encoder and DC motor or Stepper motor) types.

It supports:
* Telescope Mount control (Alt/Azm and Equatorial GEM/Fork.)  Optional support for Eq mounts with Tangent Arm Declination.  Usually the Goto capability is enabled, but that's optional as well for those who just want basic mount control.
* Telescope Rotator control (including Alt/Azm de-rotation.)
* Telescope Focuser control (up to 6 focusers so it can handle collimation as well as focusing.)
* Telescope Accessory control (combination of up to 8 dew-heaters, switches, analog PWM.)

# Features
OnStepX supports a wide variety of connection options.  Several serial
"command channels" can be utilized. One of the these is normally devoted to a USB
connection and for the other(s) choose from the following:

* Bluetooth
* ESP8266 WiFi
* Arduino M0/Ethernet Shield
* Even another USB port or RS232 serial isn't very difficult to add.

In the case of running OnStepX on an ESP32 it can provide its own Bluetooth or WiFi IP command channels without additional hardware by simply activating the feature in OnStepX.

Other software in the OnStep ecosystem include:

* an [ASCOM](http://ascom-standards.org/) driver (with IP and Serial support),
* an Android App useable over WiFi or Bluetooth equipped Phones/Tablets,
* a "built-in" website (on the Ethernet and/or WiFi device),
* a full planetarium program that controls all features ([Sky Planetarium](http://stellarjourney.com/index.php?r=site/software_sky)).

OnStep is compatible with the LX200 protocol. This means it can be controlled
from other planetarium software, like: Sky Safari, CdC (even without ASCOM),
Stellarium, etc.

There are also [INDI](http://www.indilib.org/about.html) drivers so it can be used from Linux, with CdC or KStars.

# Documentation
Detailed documentation, including the full set of features, detailed designs for
PCBs, instructions on how to build a controller, how to configure the firmware
for your particular mount, can all be found the [OnStep Group Wiki](https://groups.io/g/onstep/wiki/home).

# Change Log
All the changes are tracking in git, and a detailed list can be accessed using the
following git command:
 
git log --date=short --pretty=format:"%h %ad %<(20)%an %<(150,trunc)%s"

# Support
Questions and discussion should be on the mailing list (also accessible via the
web) at the [OnStep Group](https://groups.io/g/onstep/).
